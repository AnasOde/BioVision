**BioVision** is an **integrated** software platform for automated **instance segmentation** and **classification** across diverse imaging modalities. By utilizing **YOLOv11** as an automated prompt generator for the **SAM 2.1** foundational architecture, the platform provides a solution for high-throughput biomedical image analysis without the need for manual spatial prompting.

## 📑 **Abstract**

Accurate instance segmentation is fundamental to clinical diagnostics across diverse imaging modalities. While foundation models like the **Segment Anything Model 2.1 (SAM 2.1)** offer delineation, their reliance on manual spatial prompting can limit automated workflows. We introduce **BioVision**, an integrated deep learning platform combining task-specific, fine-tuned **You Only Look Once version 11 (YOLOv11)** region-proposal models with the foundational SAM 2.1 architecture. 

**The platform was evaluated across a spectrum of biological scales and imaging modalities, ranging from low-magnification fetal analysis and clinical tumor identification to high-resolution cellular segmentation.**

## 🔬 **Key Features**

*   **Integrated Architecture**: Combines **YOLOv11** (localization) and **SAM 2.1** (segmentation) into a single, automated pipeline.
*   **Multi-Modal Utility**: Validated for **MRI, X-ray, Ultrasound, and Brightfield Microscopy**.
*   **Automated Morphometry**: Instant export of physical descriptors (Area, Eccentricity, Centroids, etc.) to structured **Excel** and **CSV** reports.
*   **Standalone Software**: Features a dedicated **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** designed for researchers without specialized computational expertise.

## 📊 **Performance Benchmarks**

BioVision reached high accuracy levels across 20 biological targets, showing performance gains compared to zero-shot **VGG16**, **EfficientNet-B0**, and standalone **SAM 2.1** ($p < 0.05$).

| Application Area | Mean Confidence | 95% Confidence Interval (CI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brain Tumor (MRI)** | **99.56%** | [99.21%, 99.92%] |
| **Breast Cancer (X-ray)** | **97.61%** | [95.94%, 99.28%] |
| **White Blood Cells (WBC)** | **99.87%** | [99.76%, 99.98%] |
| **Multi-Organ Histology** | **94.79%** | [93.51%, 96.08%] |

## 🏗️ **Technical Workflow**

The platform operates through a sequential automated pipeline:
1.  **Detection Phase**: A fine-tuned **YOLOv11** engine identifies biological targets and generates automated bounding-box prompts.
2.  **Segmentation Phase**: These coordinates are passed to the **SAM 2.1** mask decoder, confining the transformer’s attention to specific **Regions of Interest (ROIs)** for automated boundary definition.
